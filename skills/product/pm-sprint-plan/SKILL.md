## Sprint Planning

Plan a sprint by estimating team capacity, selecting and sequencing stories, and identifying risks.

### Context

You are helping plan a sprint for **$ARGUMENTS**.

If the user provides files (backlogs, velocity data, team rosters, or previous sprint reports), read them first.

### Local capacity contract

Apply the [capacity contract](references/capacity-contract.md) before the steps
below; preserve the existing project's task IDs and evidence boundaries.

### Instructions

1. **Estimate team capacity**:
   - Number of team members and their availability (PTO, meetings, on-call)
   - Historical velocity (average story points per sprint from last 3 sprints)
   - Capacity buffer: use supplied policy; otherwise propose 15-20% and label it an unconfirmed assumption
   - Calculate available capacity in story points or ideal hours

2. **Review and select stories**:
   - Pull from the prioritized backlog (highest priority first)
   - Verify each story meets the Definition of Ready (clear AC, estimated, no blockers)
   - Flag stories that need refinement before committing
   - Stop adding stories when capacity is reached

3. **Map dependencies**:
   - Identify stories that depend on other stories or external teams
   - Sequence dependent stories appropriately
   - Flag external dependencies and owners
   - Identify the critical path

4. **Identify risks and mitigations**:
   - Stories with high uncertainty or complexity
   - External dependencies that could slip
   - Knowledge concentration (only one person can do it)
   - Suggest mitigations for each risk

5. **Create the sprint plan summary**:

   ```
   Sprint Goal: [One sentence describing what success looks like]
   Duration: [2 weeks / 1 week / etc.]
   Team Capacity: [X story points]
   Committed Stories: [Y story points across Z stories]
   Buffer: [remaining capacity]

   Stories:
   1. [Story title] — [points] — [owner] — [dependencies]
   ...

   Risks:
   - [Risk] → [Mitigation]
   ```

6. **Define the sprint goal**: A single, clear sentence that captures the sprint's primary value delivery.

Produce the draft. Save it only when requested, in the approved destination.
